# Specifications for the MVP of Easy as Ï€

## Project goals

- To offer a platform for students in Grade 1 to 5 to practice their math skills daily.
- To offer a platform for teachers to track their students' progress and offer insights
on where additional support from the teacher is needed.

###  Defining project success

- Generate math problems of varying difficulty in 5 domain areas.
- Accurately determine the ability level of the student in those 5 domain areas.
- Provide recommendations for the teacher on which skills the student needs to improve in.

### Additional requirements

- Must have a real-time aspect
- Must include third-party integration

### Opportunity statements

- How might we make authenticating simple for students?
- How might we make creating a classroom simple for teachers?
- How might we provide enough math problems for students to practice on?
- How might we make sure that the problems are at the correct level of difficulty?
- How might we adapt the app to particular student's deficiencies?
- How can we ensure that students remain engaged in the app ?
- How can we inform the teacher on the areas that students need more help?
- How can we inform the teacher on the students that are ahead/behind the rest of the class?
- How can we let the teacher influence the problems the students are working on?
