# Specifications for Easy as Pi

## Summary

The best way to learn new mathematical concepts is through practice. To this
end, students may work on exercises in their textbook, through in-class
assignments, or online. We believe these resources are lacking in that they
provide a finite number of exercises which may not be sufficient for a student
to fully understand a mathematical concept. Computer-generated mathematical
problems, problems following a particular template with generated numbers,
could an interesting area for innovation in this field. Combined with a
learning method known as spaced repetition, we think we have the ingredients
for an improved platform to teach mathematics.

## Goals

1. Display computer-generated mathematical problems to a user on a number of mathematical concepts
2. Adapt to the student’s learning rate and display problems adapted to the student’s current knowledge
3. Provide a platform for a teacher to manage a classroom and a means for students to communicate with the teacher

## Stretch goals

1. Provide any sort of dashboard system to display metric
2. Any extensive user profile features

## Client

### Authentication process

Teachers will be authenticating using their Google Account, while students will authenticate
via a teacher provided code. Students are considered too young to be expected to have a student
account.

### Student view

Students

### Teacher view

## Server

### API

The mobile app will need to be able to request or notify the server about the
following:

1. Authenticate and create an account
2. Create a classroom
3. Request a list of available math problem categories
4. Request a math problem of a certain type
5. Notify the server if the current problem has been solved or not

In addition, we need to provide real-time communication between two users.

Communication on most points can be achieved via a series of REST endpoints.

### Computer-generated mathematical problems

This is the most critical piece of this project. Hence, effort should be made to
ensure this part of the project is extensible without modification to the rest
of the project.

#### Number generation

_“In mathematics the art of asking questions is more valuable than solving
problems” — Cantor (1867)_

For this project, we can look at what the literature has to say about
mathematical problem generation.

An interesting book, called _The Art of Problem Posing_, explores the idea of
problems as being defined by a list of attributes. Comprehension of the problem
can be achieved by changing the attributes. We could perhaps use this idea for
generating mathematical problems of increasing difficulty, by identifying
attributes of a problem and changing them to create new problems.

For example:

-   All values are positive, some values are positive, all values are negative
-   There are two terms at the left of the equal sign, three, four

Attributes can be represented by a set of numerical variables and their domain. A particular combination
of values for each variable can be assigned a certain difficulty score. We can then
use an optimization algorithm to find the attributes that match as closely the targetted difficulty
score.

A likely candidate for an optimization algorithm is gradient descent with simulated annealing.
This approach starts with a random assignment and greedily attempts to find the best assignment (that is an assignment with
the requested difficulty score). A quick implementation has shown good results and performance for two variables.

http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/physical/simulated_annealing.html

The result of this algorithm is an array of values, which can then be inserted into a string template.

#### Difficulty score

The challenge is to be able to determine which numerical values to select. We describe an assignment through its
difficulty score, generated by a difficulty function. The implementation of this function is critical to ensure
the success of this project.

A prototype using a neural net has shown promising results and could be worth exploring. The simple solution would be
to hard code rules in the implementation.

It is important to note that the optimization algorithm may not be able to find the best solution depending
on the output of the difficulty function.

#### Hashing

We will guarrantee some determinism in problem generation by using a seed. By using the same seed and
the same difficulty score, we can guarrantee we can arrive to the same result.

#### Problem template

Using value assignments from the step described above, a template function will return an object
representing a math problem. This object should include the problem, solution with steps, 
difficulty score, and seed.

```typescript
interface IMathProblem {
    problemType: string;
    problem: string;
    solution: string[];
    difficulty: number;
    seed: string;
}
```

The template should be a function accepting an array of values. It is responsible for
incorporating the values inside a string representing the math problem. It may derive
additional values if necessary (for example to generate a polynomial when given the
value of the factors).  

### Adapt to the student's learning

Students can self-report whether or not they solved the problem, and whether or
not they found the problem easy. From there, the server can adjust the student's
proficiency score and select the appropriate next problem.

The key challenge is to determine the appropriate heuristic to select the next problem to show
the student based on whether or not they successfully solved the problem.

This would most likely take the shape of a function accepting a student profile. From there,
the function would indicate which problem to show at which difficulty level.

### Student profile

The application will need to store information about each student using the app. At a minimum,
we will need to store data regarding the student's proficiency score for each type of math problem and
the last time a problem of a certain type was attempted.

Teacher can view students' profile.

### Instant messaging

API required for a chat system:

-   Create a new conversation
-   Access conversations
-   Append a new message to a conversation (which would include images)
